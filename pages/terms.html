            <p class="">
                Following terms and conditions govern your access to and use of InvideoCall web application and website
                (the "Service"), and any video, sound, text, graphics, or other materials sent, received, stored or
                otherwise appearing in the Service (collectively referred to as "Content").
            </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Basic description of the Service</strong></p>

            <p>InVideoCall is a web-based communication service that allows you to have video conversations with others in the browser simply by having individual participants typing in the same URL in the browser window. Typing in the same URL will make the participants appear in the same room where you can talk to each other with voice and text chat and see each other with transmitted video. You do not have to install any software or plugins to use InVideoCall. <b id="docs-internal-guid-945e55de-8e7e-a085-51f9-daabfc16172a">Y</b>ou also do not have to register or login to use the basic video functionality of the service.</p>

            <p>Video and sound communicated in InVideoCall is only seen by the people who are present in a room at the time the content is communicated. You should be aware that by default a room is open, so anyone who knows the URL can enter the room simply by typing the URL in the browser. If anyone enters a room you are present in, you can see them in the room.</p>


            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>

            <p>In the free version of the Service, communication between participants are primarily sent through peer-to-peer connections, where audio and video streams are sent directly between participants and do not pass through any or our servers. Video and audio transmitted in the Service is then sent directly between the participants in a room and is encrypted (DTLS-SRTP) with client-generated encryption keys. In cases where a user is behind a strict firewall or NAT, video and audio need to be relayed via a TURN server,&nbsp;but end-to-end encryption is still maintained.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Use of Services</strong></p>

            <p>You are responsible for your use of the Service, including the lawfulness of the Content. All Content is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content. We may not monitor or control the Content posted via the Service and we cannot take responsibility for such Content. Any use or reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Service or obtained by you through the Service is at your own risk.</p>
