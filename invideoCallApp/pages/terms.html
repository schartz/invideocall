        <p>The following Terms of Service including <a href="/information/tos/general-terms/">Telenor Digital General Terms and Privacy Statement </a>&nbsp;as published on our website ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the appear.in application and website (the "Service"), and any video, sound, text, graphics, or other materials sent, received, stored or otherwise appearing in the Service (collectively referred to as "Content").</p>

        <p><strong>Basic description of the Service</strong></p>

        <p>appear.in is a web-based communication service that allows you to have video conversations with others in the browser simply by having individual participants typing in the same URL in the browser window. Typing in the same URL will make the participants appear in the same room where you can talk to each other with voice and text chat and see each other with transmitted video. You do not have to install any software or plugins to use appear.in. <b id="docs-internal-guid-945e55de-8e7e-a085-51f9-daabfc16172a">Y</b>ou also do not have to register or login to use the basic video functionality of the service.</p>

        <p>Video and sound communicated in appear.in is only seen by the people who are present in a room at the time the content is communicated. You should be aware that by default a room is open, so anyone who knows the URL can enter the room simply by typing the URL in the browser. If anyone enters a room you are present in, you can see them in the room.</p>

        <p>You can prevent others from entering a room by locking the room. If the room is not claimed, anyone in the room can lock it. Guests can ask to be admitted into the room by knocking. A&nbsp;notification willl then be shown inside the room&nbsp;and the users there can choose to allow the guest&nbsp;into the room.&nbsp;When all participants leave a locked room that is not claimed, the room will be opened again.</p>

        <p>You can claim a room as your own room. This will give you control over the room, and give you the ability to customize it for your own communication needs. When you claim a room, you need to register by entering your email address or phone number and enter a display name to be used in the Service. You can subsequently get access to your room by logging in. Any time you need to log in we will send a one-time code to your registered email or phone number.&nbsp;A crown symbol will be shown on the video feed of a room owner to make it apparent who is the owner.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Room owners can offer other registered users membership in a room. Room members will receive notifications of events in the room and can also enter locked rooms, add other members, accept guests into the room, block and kick people from the room. A shield with a crown symbol will be shown on the video feed of a member to make it apparent who is member. The owner can at any time remove membership. Owners and members can also kick people from the room, or block them permanently so they will not be able to enter the room from the device they were using at the time they were blocked. The owner can unblock any users that has been blocked.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>If a room is claimed, only the owner and members can lock it.&nbsp;When a claimed room is locked, only room owners and members can enter a room without knocking. Guests will be asked to knock on the room.&nbsp;Owners and members inside the room will then see a notification and can choose to allow the guest&nbsp;into the room. A claimed room will remain locked when the owner leaves it, and can then not be used by people who are not members.&nbsp;Room owners can customize a room e.g. by setting the background image in the room and by using other customization options that are or may be provided in the service in the future.</p>

        <p>Chat messages communicated in a room can be seen by people who are owners or members of a room. Others can only see chat messages if they are present in the room when the chat message is sent. Chat messages will be purged when all participants leave the room, no transcripts are saved on appear.in servers.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Rooms can&nbsp;be favorited by other&nbsp;users.&nbsp;Users who favorite a room can choose&nbsp;receive notifications of activity in the room, including the number of people currently talking in the room.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>

        <p>You understand that through your use of the Service&nbsp;you consent to the following collection and use of this information.</p>

        <p>Voice and video communicated in a room is not stored anywhere in our system. Chat messages are not stored in our system and are purged when all participants have left the room.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>You are required to register to claim a room in the service or use certain features such as following rooms or becoming a member. During registration, we store your photo (not required), display name, and at least one of the following: phone number or email address. Your display name and profile picture will be visible to people you meet in a room. Your contact information will not be visible to other users. We may use your contact information to contact you about issues with your room or to inform about the Service.</p>

        <p>When you customize a room by setting the background image of a room, the image will be stored in the Service. The uploaded image will be accessible to people who enter the room when the room isn’t locked. Any image that violates the guidelines listed in <a href="/information/tos/general-terms/">Telenor Digital General Terms and Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;may be removed without notice.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The Content stored in the Service will be stored securely with one or more of our subcontractors, and may also be temporarily stored in other locations to facilitate the transmission of the Content to and from your devices. We will ensure that any use of subcontractors located abroad is done in compliance with applicable law.</p>

        <p>Should you choose to deregister with our services we will delete all of your data stored in the Service, including your email address and phone number.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Slack Integration</strong></p>

        <p>The integration requires access to the team’s profile information of all members. This information is only used once as an option to notify other team members about the integration. It is not stored and is not used again.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Charging for Use of the Services</strong></p>

        <p>The Service is offered both as a free version and a paid premium version. You can choose to upgrade any room you have claimed to the premium plan, which will give you additional features in the specific room you have upgraded. You can upgrade more than one room, but will have to pay per room. The premium features will then be available to all users visiting the room, even if they’re anonymous. We reserve the right to change the features included in the premium plan, the price of the premium plan and the structure of the plan at any time. You will find an updated overview of the content of the plan on our <a href="/information/premium/">Premium page</a>. We will notify all paying users of such changes in advance.</p>

        <p>If your payment is not successful, your room will be downgraded to the free plan with access to premium features removed. Upgrading to premium will start a recurring subscription, and you will be billed every month in advance, on the date the subscription was first created. You can cancel the subscription at any time in “Settings” in the room, and you will then have access to premium features for the remainder of the month you have paid for. When that month ends, your room will automatically be downgraded to the free plan. Should you choose to re-activate your subscription during this period after cancellation, you will start a new subscription from the end date of the previous subscription, and will continue to have premium features.</p>

        <p>Payment processing services for appear.in, including the processing and storing of credit card data, are provided by Stripe Payments Europe, Ltd. (“Stripe”) and are subject to the <a href="https://stripe.com/no/legal" target="_blank">Stripe Services Agreement — Norway</a> (“Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to these terms or continuing to operate as an appear.in premium customer, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of appear.in enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide appear.in accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize appear.in to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>

        <p>In the free version of the Service, communication between participants are primarily sent through peer-to-peer connections, where audio and video streams are sent directly between participants and do not pass through any or our servers. Video and audio transmitted in the Service is then sent directly between the participants in a room and is encrypted (DTLS-SRTP) with client-generated encryption keys. In cases where a user is behind a strict firewall or NAT, video and audio need to be relayed via a TURN server,&nbsp;but end-to-end encryption is still maintained.</p>

        <p>If you have upgraded a room to premium, that room will use a dedicated server infrastructure to allow more people in conversation, and better stability. Your stream will be sent through&nbsp;video router&nbsp;servers which transmits it to the other participants in the call, and also transmits their streams to you. Streams will always be encrypted (DTLS-SRTP) in transit, but will be decrypted and re-encrypted when passing through the video routers. We operate an infrastructure of video routers distributed across the world, and you will be automatically routed to the closest one. The video router servers and all of our infrastructure adhere to strict security measures, preventing any eavesdropping or interruption of the video/audio streams.</p>
